Hey brother
There's an endless road to be discovered
Hey sister
Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey brother
Do you still believe in one another?
Hey sister
Do you still believe in love, I wonder?
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
